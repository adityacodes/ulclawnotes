According to **Sir William Anson** the law of contract is intended to ensure that what a man has led to expect shall come to pass and what has been promised to him shall be performed.

Law of Contract doesnot lay down a number of rights and duties which the law will enforce it consists of rather a number of limiting principles subject to which the parties nay create rights and duties for themselves which the law will uphold.

**Case Law: `Roop Kumar vs Mohan Thedani (AIR 2003)`** - Importance of written contract was laid down.

## Kinds of Contract

From the point of view of contract it is of two kinds:

1. Ordinary Contract
2. Standard Form Contract

In view of unequal bargaining power of two parties the courts have envolved following rules to _protect interest of weaker parties_:

1. Reasonable Notice
2. Reasonable Terms of Contract
3. The theory of fundamental breach
4. Strict construction of exemption clause.
5. Exclusion of contractual liability not negative tortus liability.

## Difference between an agreement and a contract

```js:CheatSheet
Contract    = Agreement + Enforceability By Law
Agreement   = Promise / Set of Promises
Promise     = Proposal + Acceptance
Proposal    = External Manifestation + seeking view of the other person.
```

### Agreement

As per Section 2(e) of Indian Contract Act 1872 "every **_promise and set of promises(1)_** forming the consideration for eachother is an agreement."

An agreement comprises if a promise or promises from **both the sides**.

- (1) Promise - When the person to whom **_proposal(2)_** is made **_signifies(3)_** his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when accepted becomes a promise.

- (2) Proposal - When one person **_signifies(3)_** to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything with a view to obtaining the assent of that other person to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.

- (3) Signifies - Signification of Willingness is the key to the definition of proposal and promise. It can be made by any mode of communication. Signifies means external manifestation.

Agreement is said to be made whenever there is a _valid set of promises_ from both the sides.

`Example:` A proposes to B to give him his radio. B signifies his acceptance of the proposal. This constitutes a **promise** on the part of A. On the other hand B proposes to pay Rs. 500 for the radio and A accepts this proposal. This constitutes a **promise**. The **two promises together** constitute an **agreement**.

### Contract

Acc to Section 2(h), "An agreement enforceable by law is a contract."

Thus in order to form a contract, the enquiry has to be at two stages: - A valid agreement - It should be enforceable by law.

As per section 10, the following conditions have to be fulfilled by an agreement to be enforceable: - Parties should be competent to contract eg. minors and unsound persons cannot contract per se. - Lawful consideration and lawful object in respect of that agreement eg. an agreement to commit theft => no contract. - There should be free consent of the perties eg. consent by force => no contract. - One, which has not expressly been declared to be void by the act.

Thus, all agreements are not contracts but all contracts are agreements. eg. an greement to supply goods will be a contract if the conditions of Section 10 are satisfied.

**Void Agreements [Section 2(g)]:** An agreement not enforceable by law is void eg. an agreement of a minor (Sections 23 to 30 talk about such agreements).

**Voidable Contracts [Section 2(i)]:** An agreement enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties thereto, but not at the option of other or others eg. when consent has been obtained by coercion, fraud, misinterpretation, or undue influence. If the party concerned doesnot avoid it, the agreement is a contract.

**Illegal Agreements:** Opposed to public policy **eg. an agreement to commit a crime or a tort is illegal**. But certain agreements may be void or voidable but not illegal, depending upon the degree if its opposition to public policy **eg. an agreement in restraint of trade is void but not illegal**.

**Void Agreements vs Voidable Contracts:**

| Void Agreements                  | Voidable Contracts              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Nullity from its very inception. | Valid until it has been voided. |
| No rights accure.                | Rights accure till its voided.  |

## Consensus ad idem (True Consent)

```
Agreement + Consideration + Intention to create Legal Relations = Contract
```

The test of contractual intention is objetive rather then it being subjective. In `CWT v. Abdul Hussain Mulla Mohd Ali 1988` the SC cuted that in addition to the existence of an agreement and the presence of consideration there is also the third contractual element in the form of intention of the parties to create legal relations.

Consensus ad idem => Lord Hannen in Smith v. Hughes held that it is essential to the creation of a contract that both parties should agree to the same thing in the same sense.

True consent is an agreement upon the same thing in the same sense as encorporated by `Section 13 of ICA` and is at the root of every contract. **True consent is said consensus ad idem.**
