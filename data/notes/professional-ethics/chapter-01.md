<details>
- After the grant of royal farman from the Mughal Emperor Jehangir in 1615 the East India Company established its factories in Surat. 
- Subsequently it established their factories in the three towns of Madras, Calcutta and Bombay. In these Presidency towns the officers of the Company structured their living quarters and the factory warehouses.
- These officers were reluctant to be governed by the laws and the legal institutions of the native land and wanted to create a separate court system in these factory towns which would govern the English people based on the English legal systems and principles. 
- The Charter Act of 1726 was issued by King George I for setting up of Mayor's Court and Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery in the three presidency towns. These courts were designated as court of record and English language was designated as the official language of the court. 
- However the Charter did not lay down any rules relating to legal practitioners or individuals who could act and plead in these courts. A fresh Charter Act was issued by King George II in 1755 but it continued the earlier court system in these three settlements. 
- During this period of time no specific rules relating to legal practitioners were followed in these courts and generally people who were formally untrained in law or ex-employee of the company acted and pleaded in these courts based on their personal common sense and logic.

Significant changes were also introduced in the judicial system by replacing the Mayor's court with the establishment of the Supreme Court in the presidency town of Calcutta,

- The Act of 1773 was extremely crucial from the perspective of growth of legal professionals in India because the legislation for the first time recognized the presence and functioning of the lawyers and regulated their ability to appear and practice in the courts. The Act empowered the Supreme Court under clause 11 to make rules and exercise powers relating to approval, admission and enrolment of advocates and attorneys-at-law. The Court had the exclusive power to remove any Advocate or Attorney on a reasonable cause. No person, other than an Advocate or Attorney, was allowed to appear and plead, or act in the Court for or on behalf of the suitors.

The British attorneys and solicitors were referred to as the Attorneys, whereas, the English and the Irish barristers and members of the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland were designated as Advocates. By virtue of the 1773 Act, the Supreme Court became an exclusive domain for the members of the British legal professionals and the Indian lawyers were denied all rights of appearance in such courts.

### Rise of the demand for Indian Bar

With the rise of the freedom movement in India, there was an escalation in the demand for legal reforms by the Indian lawyers. There was a call made for removing the distinction between barristers and vakils, and for withdrawal of the special privileges enjoyed by the British barristers and solicitors in the Indian courts. The necessity to constitute an Indian Bar was also advocated. In consequence of this growing demand, a committee was appointed under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Chamier in 1923 known as the Indian Bar Committee or the Camier Committee. This Committee made a string of recommendations like:

(1) Removal of distinction between the legal practitioners over a period of time. (ii) Bring uniformity in the provincial legal systems. (iii) Continue with the dual system for the time being but reduce the distinctions. (iv) Recognized the importance of a unified Bar. (v) Need to constitute Bar Councils for each of the High Courts.

(vi) With the approval of the High Courts, the Bar Councils will make rules relating to qualifications, admissions, certificates of practice, legal education, disciplinary proceedings etc.

(vii) Disciplinary jurisdiction of the High Courts to continue but must refer to the Bar Councils for inquiry and report.

Based on the recommendations of the **Chamier Committee**, the Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926 was enacted.

### The Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926

The law was intended to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the legal practitioners in India. The primary objective of the legislation was to constitute Bar Councils in different provinces and under the jurisdictions of the High Court. The statute provided for:
1. Every High Court shall have a Bar Council;
2. The Bar Councils, with the previous approval of the High Court, may make rules regarding the constitution and procedure of Bar Councils.
3. High Court shall prepare and maintain a roll of advocates: 4. High Court shall issue a certificate of enrollment;
5. High Courts of Calcutta and Bombay to determine the qualification and admission of advocates in the original side;
6. High Court may reprimand, suspend or remove from practice any advocate, whom it finds guilty of professional or other misconduct. The matter may be referred to the Bar Council for inquiry:
7. Rules relating to right of practice to be determined by the High Courts.
The struggle for reforms in the legal profession and working of the judicial system continued till the end of the British rule in India. Post-independence the leaders of young India carried forward their activisms to bring about a structural change in the entire administration of justice by demanding for equality of treatment between the different categories of legal professionals and for constituting a unified Bar for the whole of India.
