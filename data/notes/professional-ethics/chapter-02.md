## Meaning and Nature of Contempt of Court
**Contempt of court** refers to the act which lowers the dignity of the court or causes any form of obstruction in the administration of justice.
- Act of willful disobedience or disregard of laws and regulations
- Any misconduct with a judicial officer or court process.
- Any act of lowering the dignity of court or any attempt thereof

`Halsbury` defines contempt as consisting of words spoken or written which obstruct or tend to obstruct the administration of justice.

## Forms of Contempt
There are generally 2 forms of contempt
- Acts which disrespect the court or lower its dignity or causes any form of disruption to its functioning. This is known as **Criminal Contempt**.
- Willful disobedience or breach of any order of court. This is known as **Civil Contempt**.

- Independence of judiciary is essential for efficient functioning of the democratic principles in the society. In a rule of law based society Judiciary acts as the ultimate upholder of the rights of the people and utmost respect towards the third organ of the state is necessary for the proper maintenance of law and order in the society.

- The power of contempt is a defensive weapon in the hands of the judiciary to protect its dignity and honour in the face of unwarranted criticisms and abuse of its processes. It helps the judiciary to uphold the dignity of the court in the eyes of the society. The power of contempt is an inherent power vested with the judiciary.

`Re. Vinay Chandra Mishra Case` - To be updated

`Arundhati Roy Case` - To be updated

`Mohammed Yamin v. Om Prakash Bansal` - SC observed that the law of contempt of court is not the law for protection of judges or to place them in a position of immunity from criticism. It also observed that the press is justified in making free and fair criticism. If the press does criticize some public aspect of the judgement eg. in the realm of interpretation of law, severity of sentence etc, it cannot be contempt. But if there is an attack on the integrity of the judges by imputing motive dishonesty or incompetence, arbitrariness or want of independence to a judge, it would be exceeding free and fair criticism by press.
## Objective and Purpose of Law of Contempt
In the `Attorney General v. Times Newspapers Ltd` case, House of Lords recognized the threefold objective of the law of contempt. They are :-
i) enable the parties to litigation and the witnesses to come before the Court without outside interference;
(ii) to enable the Courts to try cases without such interference and
(iii) to ensure that authority and administration of law are maintained.

It is the duty of the legal professionals to uphold the dignity of the court.

`Lalit Mohan Das vs Advocate General, Orissa` - It was observed that a member of bar is an officer of the court and owes a duty to the court in which he is appearing. He must uphold the dignity and decorum of the curt and must not do anything to bring the court itself into disrepute.
