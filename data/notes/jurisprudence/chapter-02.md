## Idealist Definitions

`Salmond` defines law as "the body of principles recognised and applied by the state in the administration of justice."

### Criticism - To be Updated

## Positivist Definitions

According to `Austin`, law is the aggregate of sovereign, to men as policially subject. In other words 'Law is the command of sovereign.'

Thus the command duty and sanction are the three elements of law. The law which has these elements of characteristics is called 'positivist law'. He distinguishes 'positive law' from 'positive morality'. According to Austin, sovereign, command and sanction are the three basic and essential elements of law.

### Criticisms: To be updated.

## Sociological Definitions

- They define law in the terms of its relation with the society.
- Law presupposes state. There may be law even without state, as the primitive law, but law, in modern sense of the term implies state.
- The state makes or authorizes to make, recognises or sanctions rules which are called law.
- For the rules to be effective there are sanctions behind them.
- These rules (called law) are made to serve some purpose. The purpose may be a social purpose, or it may be simply to serve some personal ends of a despot.
