summary: 'Nature and value of Jurisprudence'
---

**Jurisprudence** is basically the theoretical aspect of the word law.

In JP we don't deal with the practically applicable pieces of statutory law; rather we try to understand the very essence of law and its various dimensions.

## General

Basic Questions that we try to answer in JP:

1. What is law?
2. Why should it exist?
3. What should be the nature and purpose of the law?
4. What are rights and duties and what should be their nature?
5. What is ownership and possession and why does the law have to protect them? etc

Jurisprudence refers to a certain type of inquiry or investigation into law an inquiry of a general nature the purpose of which is to bring out the underlying and essential principles of law and legal system.

While the law of contract deals with the right of one party to a contract against the other contracting party, in JP the emphasis is on the study of nature and underlying meaning of the term 'right' and different kinds of legal rights.

As observed by `Salmond`,

> in jurisprudence we are not concerned to derive rules from authority and apply them to problems, we are concerned rather reflect on the nature of legal rules and underlying meaning of legal concepts and in the essential features of the legal system

## Value of Jurisprudence

In general, Jurisprudence cannot be applied to practical situations.

The question arises: What possible value can there be in an abstract subject like Jurisprudence?

`Salmond` in his **Treaties on jurisprudence** has mentioned the following uses of jurisprudence:

1. Value of Jurisprudence lies in its own intrinsic interest
2. Serving to make law's complexity more manageable and rational
3. JP has an educational value. JP can influence a lawyer to look around him and create an awareness that answers to new legal problems must be found by consideration of present social needs and realities than in the wisdom of the past.
4. JP gives shape to practical law. It helps in shaping the practical law in a form so that it can serve society.

## Schools of Jurisprudence

The schools of jurisprudence are a result of various approaches of the jurists to the problem of **'the nature of law'**.

## Definitions of Jurisprudence

The study of jurisprudence started first among the Roman jurists. Jurisprudence has been derived from the Latin Word Juris (means legal) prudentia(knowledge or skill). Initially, JP was confused with morality later the concept was secularised.

The word began to acquire a technical significance in the time of Bentham and his disciple Austin.

<details>
`Ulpian` - Jurisprudence is the knowledge of things divine and human the science of right and wrong.

`Paulus (Roman Jurist)` - JP is the knowledge of things divine and human the science of right and wrong.

`Black Stone` - JP is the study of the science of law.

`Wurzel` - Jurisprudence is the first of social science to be born.

`Bentham (1748-1832)` - His theory is called a "utilitarian individualism" - He was an individualist.

    - He criticized the method of law making corruption and inefficiency of the administration of justice and restraints on the individual's liberty.

    - He said that function of law is to emancipate an individual from bondage and restraint upon his freedom.

    - Once the individual is free he himself shall be looking after his welfare.

    - According to him the end of legislation is the 'greatest happiness of the greatest number'.

    - He gave the theory of **pleasure and pain**. The purpose of the law is to bring pleasure and avoid pain.

    - Gave the concept of "felicific calculus" - Under this, Bentham presented a chart as per which the pleasures and pains could be calculated.

    - He wrote 1) Theory of Legislation 2) Limits of Jurisprudence ( in 1782 published in 1945 )

`Friedman` - In his book, Legal Theory criticized Bentham on failure to develop his own conception of the balance between individual and community interests.

`John D Finch` - In Introduction to legal theory criticized Bentham. With Bentham came the advent of legal positivism but it was far from containing the solution to problems involving the nature of positive law.

`Salmond` - JP is the science of first principles of civil law. JP according to Salmond deals with law of state consisting of rules applied by courts in the administration of Justice. There are 3 kinds of law that govern the conduct of human beings i.e.

1. Law which emanates from theology
2. Law which emanates from morality
3. Law which emanates from a politically organized society

True law is the law that exists in politically organized society and Salmond calls it civil law the study of that law is the fit subject for study of jurisprudence.

Salmond broadly incorporates in his definition:

1. Analytical JP
2. Historical JP
3. Ethical JP

He uses JP in both generic and specific sense. The former included the entire body of legal doctrines, whereas the latter means only a particular department of such doctrines. In the latter sense it may be called 'theoretical' or 'general' jurisprudence.

Another classification that Salmond makes is -

1. Expository or systematic, which deals with the contents of an actual legal system.
2. Legal History, which is concerned with a legal system in its process of historical development.
3. The science of legislation, the purpose of which is to set forth law as it ought to be. It deals with the ideal future of legal system.

`Austin` - JP is the philosophy of positive law. Positive law is akin to civil law. (However, the term 'philosophy' used by Austin may be said to be inaccurate as JP confines itself to civil or man made law.)

`Holland` - JP is the formal science of positive law. He further states that JP deals with the human relations governed by the rule of law rather than the material rules themselves.

`Gray` - The relation of JP to law depends not upon what law is treated but how law is treated.

`Hart` - Law is a system of rules - primary and secondary - the combination of which explains the nature of law and provides key to jurisprudence.

Primary rules are duty imposing rules and the secondary rules are to confer power which provide for the creation or variation of duties.

`Allen` - JP is the scientific synthesis of essential principles of law.

`Paton` - Modern JP trenches on the fields of social sciences and of philosophy, it digs into the historical past and tends to create the symmetry of a garden out of luxuriant chaos of conflicting legal systems.

`Jullius Stone` - It is the lawyers examination of the percepts ideal and techniques of the law derived from present knowledge in disciplines other than law.

`Patterson` - JP means a body of ordered knowledge, which dealt with a particular species of law.

`Keeton` - JP is the study and systematic arrangement of general principles of law.

`Wayne Morrison` - JP is defined as the corpus of answers to the question what is law.
