## Proposal or Offer

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} fromHeading={3} toHeading={4} asDisclosure />

### General

Proposal lies at the very root of the formation of a contract.

When one **person** signifies to another his **willingness** to do or to abstain from doing anything **with a view to obtaining the assent of that other person** to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.

### Important words in the above definitions (their implications):

    - **Person :** Has to be a legal person (natural or juristic, including a corporation).
    - **Willingness :** It implies an intention (a vouluntary one) to do or to abstain from doing something.
    - **With a view to obtaining the assent of that other :** Intention to obtain the assent of another person has to be there.
    eg. A makes a general styatement in front of B that he intends to sell his radio. It wont amount to a proposal unless it is accompanied by an intention to obtain B's assent thereto.

- `Proposal` in the Indian Contract Act is synonymous with `offer` in English Law.

### Intention to create a legal relationship

In order to form a valid agreement after acceptance, a proposal has to be made with an intention to create a legal relationship. The test to judge the intention is an objective test and not a subjective one;

The intention at the time of making the proposal is what is material eg. in an agreement to go for a walk, to go to a movie etc. there is no intention to create a legal relationship (CLR).

`Appleson v. Littlewood Ltd. (1939)` - Parties may expressly mention there is no intention to create legal relationship (CLR).

```
Generally, in social engagements such an intention is presumed to be lacking.
```

`Rose and Frank Co. v. Crompton and Brothers Ltd. (1925)` - Intention to CLR was expressly mentioned.

`Balfour v. Balfour (1919)` - Intention not to CLR was found to be implied. (between husband and wife)

<details>
Defendant,a husband employed in Ceylon had promised to send 30 pounds to his wife the plaintiff till she was in england (on account of illness). The husband failed to send money and the wife sued for the same. Atkin LJ delivered the judgement. He held that the agreement in the case was not intended to create a legal relationship.

An agreement between a husband and a wife generally lacks the intention to create a legal relationship as parties can be presumed not to have intended to be attended by legal consequences.

`Jones v. Padavatton (1969)` - Extended above intention to other close relationships (between parents and children).

<details>
Case Details to be provided here... Later

It was held that as the contract had not been reduced to writing not the duration which she was to be maintained had been mentioned => No intention to create legal relationship could be implied.

</details>

`Merrit v. Merrit (1970)` - It was held that there was a clear intention to create a legal relationship.

<details>
 Husband and wife were joint owners of a house which was subject to mortgage to a building society. Husband went to live with another woman and by signing a note agreed to transfer the house property to wife if she cleared all outstanding amount with respect to the house. Here, it was held that there was a clear intention to create a legal relationship.
</details>

`Mc Gregor v. Mc Gregor (1888)` - Similar Case.

**Conclusion:** Thus it is the intention (to be tested on the criterion of objectivity) that is material. The intention can be inferred from a variety of facts. But generally in case of social relationships (particularly close relationships), such intention is presumed to be lacking unless the contrary is proved.

**Tests:** - Intention Important => To create legal relationship. - Objective test => Facts to be seen. - Intention at the time of the agreement is important.

2. ### Communication of Offer

Acceptance of a proposal is a must in order to constitute a promise. And in order to be accepted, a proposal must be communicated. Section 2(b) uses the word **signifies** with respect to the proposer.

**Signifies** means a communication by some mode of communication, for an offer can be accepted only when it comes to the knowledge of the proposee.

In order to constitute a valid proposal, the communication of the proposal must be complete against the proposee. **Acting (or act done), in ignorance of the offer, doesnot amount to the acceptance of the same.**

`Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913)`

<details>

**Plaintiff** - Servant of defendant

**Defendant** - Gauri Dutt

The defendant's nephew absconded from home. Later on defendant issued handbills anouncing reward of Rs. 501 to anyone who might find out the boy. The plaintiff who was ignorant of the proposal found out the boy. He brought an action to claim the reward.

It was held that as he was ignorant of the proposal, the **communication of the porposal had not been completed** and hence there was no question of a binding contract even if other conditions were satisfied. => His claim failed.

Section 3, ICA, 1872 says that "the communication of proposals are deemed to be made by any act or omission of the party proposing by which he intends to communicate such proposal or which has the effect of communicating it."
