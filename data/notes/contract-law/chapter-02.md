## Proposal or Offer

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} fromHeading={3} toHeading={4} asDisclosure />

### General

Proposal lies at the very root of the formation of a contract.

When one **person** signifies to another his **willingness** to do or to abstain from doing anything **with a view to obtaining the assent of that other person** to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal.

### Important words in the above definitions (their implications)

    - **Person :** Has to be a legal person (natural or juristic, including a corporation).
    - **Willingness :** It implies an intention (a vouluntary one) to do or to abstain from doing something.
    - **With a view to obtaining the assent of that other :** Intention to obtain the assent of another person has to be there.
    eg. A makes a general styatement in front of B that he intends to sell his radio. It wont amount to a proposal unless it is accompanied by an intention to obtain B's assent thereto.

- `Proposal` in the Indian Contract Act is synonymous with `offer` in English Law.

### Intention to create a legal relationship

In order to form a valid agreement after acceptance, a proposal has to be made with an intention to create a legal relationship. The test to judge the intention is an objective test and not a subjective one;

The intention at the time of making the proposal is what is material eg. in an agreement to go for a walk, to go to a movie etc. there is no intention to create a legal relationship (CLR).

`Appleson v. Littlewood Ltd. (1939)` - Parties may expressly mention there is no intention to create legal relationship (CLR).

```
Generally, in social engagements such an intention is presumed to be lacking.
```

`Rose and Frank Co. v. Crompton and Brothers Ltd. (1925)` - Intention to CLR was expressly mentioned.

`Balfour v. Balfour (1919)` - Intention not to CLR was found to be implied. (between husband and wife)

<details>
Defendant,a husband employed in Ceylon had promised to send 30 pounds to his wife the plaintiff till she was in england (on account of illness). The husband failed to send money and the wife sued for the same. Atkin LJ delivered the judgement. He held that the agreement in the case was not intended to create a legal relationship.

An agreement between a husband and a wife generally lacks the intention to create a legal relationship as parties can be presumed not to have intended to be attended by legal consequences.

</details>

`Jones v. Padavatton (1969)` - Extended above intention to other close relationships (between parents and children).

<details>
Case Details to be Updated.

It was held that as the contract had not been reduced to writing not the duration which she was to be maintained had been mentioned => No intention to create legal relationship could be implied.

</details>

`Merrit v. Merrit (1970)` - It was held that there was a clear intention to create a legal relationship.

<details>
 Husband and wife were joint owners of a house which was subject to mortgage to a building society. Husband went to live with another woman and by signing a note agreed to transfer the house property to wife if she cleared all outstanding amount with respect to the house. Here, it was held that there was a clear intention to create a legal relationship.
</details>

`Mc Gregor v. Mc Gregor (1888)` - Similar Case.

**Conclusion:** Thus it is the intention (to be tested on the criterion of objectivity) that is material. The intention can be inferred from a variety of facts. But generally in case of social relationships (particularly close relationships), such intention is presumed to be lacking unless the contrary is proved.

**Tests:**

- Intention Important => To create legal relationship.
- Objective test => Facts to be seen.
- Intention at the time of the agreement is important.

2. ### Communication of Offer

Acceptance of a proposal is a must in order to constitute a promise. And in order to be accepted, a proposal must be communicated. Section 2(b) uses the word **signifies** with respect to the proposer.

**Signifies** means a communication by some mode of communication, for an offer can be accepted only when it comes to the knowledge of the proposee.

In order to constitute a valid proposal, the communication of the proposal must be complete against the proposee. **Acting (or act done), in ignorance of the offer, doesnot amount to the acceptance of the same.**

`Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913)` - Action was done without knowledge of the reward. Hence claim failed.

<details>
    **Plaintiff** - Servant of defendant

    **Defendant** - Gauri Dutt

    The defendant's nephew absconded from home. Later on defendant issued handbills anouncing reward of Rs. 501 to anyone who might find out the boy. The plaintiff who was ignorant of the proposal found out the boy. He brought an action to claim the reward.

    It was held that as he was ignorant of the proposal, the **communication of the porposal had not been completed** and hence there was no question of a binding contract even if other conditions were satisfied. => His claim failed.

</details>

**Section 3, ICA, 1872** says that "the communication of proposals are deemed to be made by any act or omission of the party proposing by which he intends to communicate such proposal or which has the effect of communicating it."

The mere intention to communicate is not sufficient. There has to be an external manifestation of the same by the way of some act or omission.

`Example:` A intends to sell his house tbut remains quient. There is no communication of porposal. He tells this to B, the communication is complete against B but **not for C** who is told about this by B unless A intended B to communicate it to C.

If a person has knowledge of the offer, his acting in accordance with the terms thereof amounts to the acceptance of the same. In such cases it is immaterial that at the time of accepting the offer the acceptor doesnot intend to claim the reward mentioned in the offer.

`Williams v. Carwardine (1833)` - Acceptance had been made with the knowledge of the offer hence there was a valid contract.

<details>
 Case Details :
 The plaintiff knew that reward had been announced to be given to anyone who gave information leading to the conviction of an assailant for murder, gave the necessary information in order to ease her conscience and not intending to claim reward. But later on she brought an action to claim the reward. It was held that acceptance had been made with a knowlege of the offer, there was a valid contract.

3. ### Cross Offers

A contract can arise only if a party having the knowledge of an offer from ther other party had accepted the same.

`Example:` If A through a letter, offers to B to sell his radio to B for Rs. 500/-. B receives the letter and validly accepts the offer. A valid contract results here.

However, if A make the offer through a letter and B also makes a offer on the same date, there will ensue no binding contract as neither had the knowledge of the offer from the other party and as a result there was no valid acceptance. Such offers are called **CROSS OFFERS**.

`Tinn v. Hoffmann (1873)` - It was held that two offers were cross offers and there was no binding contract.

It is also notable that to be a cross offer, it is not necessary that the two offers should be posted on the same date, **one should have been posted before the communication of the first was completed** (there can be changed terms also).
Cross offers donot cancel eachother.

### Invitation to treat

Owing to nature of business, a person may not make an offer but make some statement or give some information with a view to inviting offers on that basis eg. A catalogue of goods sent to customer by a shopkeeper, Government Tenders etc.

**Such cases are an invitation to make an offer (to treat)**, eg. A invites persons to an auction. This is an invitation to treat. Bids made by the persons in the auction are an offer. Offer is accepted only by the fall of the hammer ðŸ”¨. Similarly a bidder can withdraw his bid (offer) before the fall of the hammer. An auctioner can even cancel the sale announced by him.

`Harris v. Nickerson (1873)` - Plaintiff brought an action against the auctioner to recover travel expenses after the auction was cancelled. It was held that advertisement of the auction was a **mere invitation to treat and its acceptance didnot amount to a binding contract**. Thus the defendant was not liable.

`Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists Ltd. (1952)` - Mere invitation to treat doesnot amount to an offer to sell.

<details>

Defendants : Business in retail sell of drugs ~(Think Big Bazar/Appolo)~. Medicines were displayed on the shelves and their retail prices were also indicated under a self-service system. The selected goods were to be taken to a cash counter where there was placed a registered pharmacist who had been authorized to stop any customer removing any drugs from their premises.

QUESTION: Was the display of goods with their prices amounted to an offer?

Lord Goddard, CJ observed that "It is a well established principle that the mere exposure of goods for sale by a shopkeeper **indicates to the public that he is willing treat but doesnot amount to an offer to sell**. That principle cannot be reversed merely because there is a self service scheme in operation."

The **reason given by the CJ** was one of the ordinary principles of common sense and of commerce:

Strange consequences would flow if the above stated principle is negated - a customer picks up a good and the property passes on to him and the shopkeeper cannot refuse to sell the good. On the other hand customer cannot keep the good back (even if it is defective) and the shopkeeper would successfully be able to insist him to purchase the article. Both the above consequences are undesirable.

`Harvey v. Facey (1893)` - For a binding contract an acceptance of offer is a must.

<details>
    Plaintiff was interested in pruchasing a plot of land called Bumper Hall Pen owned by defendants.
    
    Telegraph by Plaintiff: 'Will you sell us BHP? Telegraph us the lowest cash price.'

    Reply by Defendant: 'Lowest price for BHP is 900 pounds.'

    Telegraph by Plaintiff: 'We agree to buy BHP for 900 pounds, asked by you. Please send us title deeds.'

    QUESTION: Whether the telegram message of the defendant amounted to an offer?

    Privy council held that the defendant had replied only to the second question of the plaintiffs first telegraph. It amounted only to an invitation to treat, and the plaintiffs second telegram amounted only to an offer by plaintiff and not acceptance to an offer. For a binding contract there was a need for a further acceptance of this offer by the defendants.

`Mac Pherson v. Appanna (AIR 1951 SC 184)` - For a binding contract an acceptance of offer is a must.

<details>

- He again wrote to the defendant's agent asking whether the earlier offer had been accepted.
- He also offered to pay a higher price if found reasonable.
- Agent replied that he wouldnot accept anything less than Rs. 10000
- The plaintiff wrote that he was willing to pay Rs. 10000.
- **It was held that** the agents letter only amounted to an invitation to treat and the defendant needed to accept the offer made by the plaintiffin the second letter in order to constitute a binding contract.
</details>

`Badri Prasad v. State of MP (AIR 1970 SC 76)` - Conditional acceptance of contract is no contract.

<details>
- Forest officer wrote to the plaintiff to communicate whether he agreed to pay a further sumof Rs. 17000 for the contract of big trees.
- Plaintiff replied that he agreed to pay provided that his earlier claim for a refund of Rs. 17000 was accepted.
- **SC held that** first the FO's letter was a mere invitation to treat and secondly, even if it were considered to be an offer, the plaintiff's acceptance was conditional acceptance.
- Hence there was no contract in any case.
</details>

4. ### General Offers

A general offer is an **offer to the public at large** and anyone who **performs the conditions of the offer** is deemed to have accepted the offer eg. A makes an offer that he would reward any person who finds his lost child. This is a general offer.

- There is no need to communicate acceptance of such offer.
- Offer can be informed after the conditions have been fulfileed.
- As per **SECTION 8, ICA** - Performance of the conditions of a proposal is an acceptance of the proposal.

**In Specific Offers communication of acceptance is a must.**

- Though the offer is made to the public at large, the contract is concluded only with the person or persons who act(s) upon the terms of the offer.

5. ### Standing, open or continuing offers

An offer may be allowed to remain open for acceptance over a certain period of time. Such an offer is a standing/open/continuing offer.

eg. an offer to supply 1000 bales of cotton from 01.01.2022 to 30.01.2022 is an open offer. The contract is concluded only when an order is placed.

Tenders for supply of goods are also open offers. Advertisement inviting tenders are only an invitation to treat. **Acceptance or approval of the tender constitutes a standing offer.** As and **when an order is placed it constitutes an acceptance of the offer => binding contracts.**
