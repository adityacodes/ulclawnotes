## MINOR
According to section 3 of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 a person below 18 years of age **is a minor**.
However, a person to whose person or property a guardian has been appointed by the court remains a minor till the age of 21 years.
### Nature of a Minor's Agreement
In India - 
    Neither Section 10 nor 11 makes it clear whether the agreement entered by the minor is voidable at his option or altogether void.

    Resolved in Privy Council decision in `Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh Privy Council [1903]` where it was held that Minors agreement is absolutely void. 

    A minor's agreement being void ab-initio (from the initial state / beginning) it is incapable of being validated by a subsequent ratification after the minor has attained the age of majority.

    



### Effect of Minor's Agreement

    - No estoppel against a minor

    - No liability in contract or in tort arising out of contract

## The Doctrine of Restitution 
Question - ( Can Minor be asked to return the benefits secured by him?)



## Contracts That Are Beneficial To The Minor

## Ratification Of A Minor's Contract

## Minor's Liability For Necessaries [Section 68]

## Persons of Unsound Mind
