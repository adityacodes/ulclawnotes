## I. Effect / Importance of Acceptance

- A contract is created only after an offer is accepted.
- Before acceptance neither party is bound.
- After offer has been accepted it becomes a promise, in which if other conditions of a valid contract are satisfied, binds both the parties to the promise.

## II. Essentials of a Valid Acceptance

    1. ### Communication of Proposal and Acceptance

        Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act says that the proposal is accepted only when the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, which makes the proposal deemed to be accepted.

        ```
            Person to whom proposal is made gives assent => It becomes a promise.
        ```

    - #### a) About Communication of Acceptance
        
        - The principle is that there should be some external manifestation of acceptance.
        - A mere mental determination to accept unaccompanied by an external indication will not be sufficient. 
        - Such manifestation may be in the form of express words ( written or spoken) or may be signified through conduct by which he intends to communicate such proposal / acceptance of proposals/revocation of proposals or which has the effect of communicating it.
         
        
        ##### **Section 4 of ICA**
        > The communication of acceptance is complete, -
        > - As againt the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him so as to be out of the power of the acceptor.
        > - As against to acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer, or his authorized agent.
        Illustration:

        a) A proposes, by letter, to sell a house to B at a certain price.
            
            The communication of the proposal is complete when B receives the letter.
        
        b) B accepts A's proposal by a letter sent by post.
            
            The communication of the acceptance is complete,
            - as against A, when the letter is posted,
            - as against B, when the letter is received by A.

    - #### b) Communication by the offeree to the offeror only
        1. Acceptance must be communicated üì¢ to the offeror himself. 
        2. A communication to any other person is as influential as if no communication üîá has been made.
        3. Offerer **cannot** impose upon the offeree a duty to reply ‚§¥Ô∏è and therefore an offeror **cannot** say that failure to reply will be deemed to be the acceptance of the offer.

        `Felthouse v. Bindley` - Mental acceptance is not enough, for a binding contract there has to be an external manifestation. (Nephew without replying to uncles letter had asked uncle to take asway the horse and pay the price).

    - #### c) Communication must be made by the offeree or his authorized agent

        1. Only offeree can accept the offer.
        2. If an unauthorized person makes the communication it doesnot result in a contract.
        
        `Powell v. Lee` - There must be notice of acceptance from contracting party in some way. Information by an unauthorized agent is insufficient.

    - #### d) Communication of acceptance to a wrong person is no acceptance

        - The offerer becomes bound immediately on the posting of the letter to him.
        - If letter of acceptance is posted at wrong address or to a wrong person that will not bind the offeror.

        **Case Laws Relating to Rules in Postal Communication :**

        <details>
            `Karan Singh v. The Collector Chattarpur` - The offeror becomes bound immediately on the posting of the letter to him and it makes no difference that the letter is delayed in transits or it is even lost in post and the offeror never receives it. 
            A complete contract arises on the date when the letter of acceptance is posted or in due course. The only condition is that the letter should be correctly addressed.

            `Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co v. Grant` - Letter lost / never received. Held that the offeror is bound by contract.

            `Dunlop v. Higgins` - Due to frosty weather the letter of acceptance was delayed. Held that the offeror is bound by contract.

            `Adams v. Lindsell` - The acceptance was delayed. Held that the offeror is bound by the contract.

        </details>

        **Case Laws Relating to Rules in Telex / Telephone Communication (Instantaneous):**

        
        <details>
            `Entores Ltd v. Miles Far East Corporation` - Telex - It was held that the contract is only complete when the acceptance is received by the offeror; and the contract is made at the place where the acceptance is received.

            `Bhagwandas Kedia v. Girdhair Lal` - Telephone - It was held that the contract becomes complete when the acceptannce of the offer is intimated to the offeror. He (Shah J.) continued to say that the draftsman of the Indian Contract Act could not have envisaged use of telephone because it had not been invented and therefore the words of the section should be confined to communications by post.

            - The law was framed at a time when telephones, wireless, telestar and early bird were not contemplated, the language of Section 4 is flexible enough to cover telephone communications. The courts should not completely ignore the language of the act. When the words of acceptance was spoken over the telephone, they are put into the course of transmission to the offeror so as to be beyond the power of the acceptor. The acceptor cannot recall them. The communication being instantaneous the contract immediately arises.

    2. ### Acceptance Should be Absolute and Unqualified
        1. Acceptance lapses by rejection or counter offer. 
        2. An acceptance with variation is no acceptance. 
        3. A counter proposal must be accepted by the original promisor before a contract is made.
        4. An acceptance of part of the offer is no accpetance unless offeror agrees to qualified acceptance.

        Case Laws:

        `Hyde v. Wrench` - By conditional acceptance or counter-offer the original offer is deemed to be rejected. Once the original offer is destroyed by a counter offer, it is dead offer and cannot be accepted unless renewed.

        `Badri Pd. v. State of MP` - Acceptance should be of the whole of the offer. The offeree cannot accept a part of its terms which are favourable to him üòÜ and reject the rest. such an acceptance is another kind of counter proposal and doesnot bind the offeror unless he agrees to the qualified acceptance. 

        #### Provisional Acceptance

        An acceptance is sometimes made subject to final approval; a provisional acceptance of this kind doesnot ordinarily bind either party until the final approval is given.

        - Offeror is at the liberty to cancel the offer.
        - Any prohibition regarding cancellation is merely a 'nudum pactum'.
        - When a provisional acceptance is subsequently confirmed, the fact would be notified to the offeror for it is only then that he becomes finally bound.

        Case Laws:
        `Hardwar Singh v. Bagun Sumbrui` - Confirmation of acceptance still in progress.

        `Bengal Coal Company v. Homi Wadia` - Tender can be withdrawn before final acceptance by a work or supply order.

        `UOI v. Maddala Thathiah` - Clause is a tender authorizing the party inviting tenders to terminate the contract at anytime for the future supplies doesnot destroy the very basis of the contract and the clause is valid.

    3. ### Mode of Acceptance

        1. Usual / reasonable manner. In the manner prescribed or indicated by the offeror.
        2. Acceptance given in any other manner may not be effectve particularly where the offeror clearly insists that the acceptance shall be made in the prescribed manner.

        Case Laws:
        `Elliasion v. Henshaw` - A offered to B to send acceptance by wagon, B sent it by post thinking it would reach expeditiously, the post arrived after the time of the wagon. A was held not bound by acceptance.

    4. ### While Offer Subsisting
        Acceptance should be made while offer is subsisting and not when it has been withdrawn/lapsed/rejected.

## III. Revocation of Offer and Acceptance
    **Section 4 of ICA -**
    > The communication of **acceptance is complete**, -
    > - As againt the proposer, when it is put in a course of transmission to him so as to be out of the power of the acceptor.
    > - As against to acceptor, when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer, or his authorized agent.

    > The communication of a **revocation is complete**,
    > - As against the person who makes it, when it is put into a course of transmission to the person to whom it is made, so as to be out of the power of the person who makes it.
    > - As against the person to whom it is made, when it comes to his knowledge.

    Illustration:

        a) A proposes, by letter, to sell a house to B at a certain price.
           - The communication of the proposal is complete when B receives the letter.
        
        b) B accepts A's proposal by a letter sent by post. 
            The communication of the acceptance is complete,
            - as against A, when the letter is posted,
            - as against B, when the letter is received by A.

        **c) A revokes his proposal by telegram:**
            - The recovation is complete as against A when the telegram is posted.
            - It is complete as against B when B receives it.
            - B revokes his acceptance by telegram. B's recovation is complete as against B when the telegram is posted and as against A when it reaches him.

    **Important - The Contract Act gives both proposer and acceptor the option of revoking their communication, before a completed contract comes into existence. Thus revocation is an option given to the parties to stop the contract from coming into existence.**
### 1. Revocation of Proposal
    Section 6 layes down the circumstances when an offer lapses i.e. modes of revocation.
   - #### Notice of Revocation
        Section 5 provides that "a proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of its acceptance is complete as against the proposer, but not afterwards."

        As against the proposer, the communication of acceptance is complete "when it is put in a course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of acceptor" (Section 4)

        **Thus for the communication of revocation to be effective, it must reach the acceptor before he mails his acceptance and makes it out of his power.** No question of revocation can possibly arise in case of a contact over telephone.

        **Illustration:** A proposes by letter sent by post, to sell his house to B. B accepts the proposal by a letter sent by post. A may revoke his proposal at anytime before or at the moment when B posts his letter of acceptance but not afterwards.

        `Henthron v. Fraser (1892) 2 Ch 27` - Court observed that a person who has made an offer must be considered as continuously making it until he has brought to the knowledge of the person to whom it was made that it is withdrawn.


        `Alfred Schonlank v. M. Chetti (1892) 2 Mad LJ 57` - Defendant left an offer to sell certain goods at plaintiff's office allowing him 8 days time to give answer. On the 4th day defendant revoked his proposal. Plaintiff accepted it on 5th day however. (Decision to be updated.)

        `Dickinson v. Dodds (1876) 2 Ch D 463` - It was held that sale to a 3rd person, which came to the knowledge of the person to whom the offer was made was an effectual withdrawl of offer.

   - #### Lapse of time
        - An offer lapses on the expiry of the time, if any, fixed for acceptance. 
        - However **it is enough if the acceptor has posted acceptance before the stipulated time**, even if it reaches the offerer after the stipulated date.
        - Where no time for acceptance is prescribed, the offer has to be accepted within a reasonable time.
        - Where the subject matter of contract is an article, like gold, the price of which rapidly fluctuates in the market, very short period will be regarded as reasonable, but not so in reference to land.

   - #### By failure to fulfill a condition precedent
        Where the offer is subject to a condition precedent, it lapses if it is accepted without fulfilling the condition ( eg. deposit of earnest money )

   - #### By dealth or insanity of offeror
        An offer lapses on the death or insanity of the offeror, provided that the fact comes to the knowledge of the offeree before he makes his acceptance. It means that if such fact has not come to his knowledge while he accepts the offer, it is valid acceptance giving rise to contractual obligations.

        **Act is silent about the effect of death of the offeree.** As an offer can be accepted only by an offeree, where he died before posting the letter of acceptance, the offer lapses.

### 2. Revocation of Acceptance
    In India, acceptance is generally revocable.
    - Section 5 provides that an acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards. 

    - As against the acceptor, the communication is complete when the acceptance comes to the knowledge of the offerer i.e. when the letter of acceptance reaches the offeror (Section 4).

    - An acceptor may cancel his acceptance by a speedier mode of communication, which will reach earlier than the acceptance itself.


    - If letter of acceptance and letter of revocation reach together, then also the acceptance will be deemed to have been revoked. However some authors are of the view that formation of contract will depend on which letter is opened first. 

    - If acceptance is opened first, revocation is invalid and if letter of revocation is opened first, revocation is valid. Thus such contracts are called **'accidental form of contracts'**.
